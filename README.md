# myFolders
Working with folders in computer.

There is everything what you need for working with folders. To work with files use my class myFiles. All functions are shared because most of them you call so often that there is no need to create always new class instance.

I would like to pass on my experience in VB.Net to others and thus support this language for future generations. There are difficult beginnings in any programming language, when you have to learn to use new language libraries so that you can take even the smallest step. I want to help you with that now. You're welcome, signed Zdeněk Jantač.
